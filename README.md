## **Project Execution and Key Tasks**
The project was structured into multiple tasks, each building upon the previous to form a comprehensive analysis. Below is a breakdown of each stage of execution:

### **1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
The project began with an exploration of the **customer transaction dataset**, which contained information about purchases made across different store locations.

- **Data Cleaning:**
  - Handled missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset.
  - Standardized formats for customer transactions.
  - Removed duplicate or redundant records to ensure accuracy.
  
- **Data Understanding:**
  - Identified key variables such as customer ID, product category, purchase amount, and transaction time.
  - Explored summary statistics to understand spending patterns and customer segmentation.

### **2. Customer Analytics and Segmentation**
To gain insights into customer behavior, the next step was to segment customers based on their purchasing patterns.

- **Key Insights Derived:**
  - Identified high-value customers contributing to the majority of sales.
  - Segmented customers based on frequency, recency, and monetary value.
  - Analyzed purchasing trends across different product categories.
  
- **Statistical Techniques Used:**
  - **RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value)** to classify customers.
  - **Descriptive Analytics** to find purchasing patterns and trends.

### **3. Benchmark Store Selection for Uplift Testing**
One of the primary goals was to **select benchmark stores** to measure the impact of a store layout change through **uplift testing**.

- **Methodology Applied:**
  - Selected trial stores where layout modifications were made.
  - Identified control stores (benchmark stores) with similar sales trends and customer demographics.
  - Used statistical techniques to ensure similarity between control and trial stores.
  
- **Approach to Store Selection:**
  - Performed correlation analysis between store sales data.
  - Applied **K-means clustering** to group stores with similar characteristics.
  - Validated store selection by comparing past sales performance.

### **4. Impact Measurement and Business Insights**
Once the benchmark stores were identified, the next step was to analyze the impact of the **store layout changes**.

- **Key Metrics Analyzed:**
  - Sales growth before and after store modifications.
  - Customer footfall and average purchase amount.
  - Category-wise impact on sales performance.
  
- **Data Visualization:**
  - Created **Power BI dashboards** and **Matplotlib/Seaborn plots** to display sales trends.
  - Used **histograms and box plots** to analyze changes in customer spending behavior.

### **5. Delivering Actionable Recommendations**
Based on the **data-driven insights**, a **comprehensive report** was prepared for the **Category Manager** with key recommendations:

- **Recommendation 1:** Expand store layout modifications to additional locations where similar sales uplift is expected.
- **Recommendation 2:** Optimize product placement based on customer preferences identified in segmentation analysis.
- **Recommendation 3:** Personalize promotions for high-value customer segments to increase retention and sales.
- **Recommendation 4:** Conduct further A/B testing to refine store layouts and measure long-term effects.
